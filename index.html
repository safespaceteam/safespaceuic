                <h3>We want you to feel your best and live your best life.</h3>
                <p>We understand there are times in life that a person is not going to feel up to the task, they are not going to want to finish something because they are overwhelmed, they may just feel alone that day. We know this because at some point in time everyone feels this way, Us included. this is why we made it possible for you, yourself, to remind yourself that it is a phase, it will pass, and that you are strong, smart, courageous able to do whatever it is you put your mind to. With "SAFESPACE" you are able to remind yourself throughout the day with messages just that and more. Let us as a community push each other pass the limits that we place upon our selves to become the best we can be and live the best life we can. </p>

                                My mom showed me this app, telling me that we can send each other messages throughout the day scheduling when to send what message. At first I was like how can that help, but I promised my mother that I would try it. I was hooked when my mother sent me a message that she loved me no matter what we go through every hour on the hour for the whole day. I still smile ear to ear thinking about that.
